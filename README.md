What is Cloud Native? From the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)'s FAQ:

> Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to be:
> 1. Containerized. Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.
> 1. Dynamically orchestrated. Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.
> 1. Microservices oriented. Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.
